                           # PART ONE: INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
          
    * Software engineering involves the development of software using scientifically sound engineering principles and 
      procedures to enable its compatibility, efficiency and reliability on real machines.
      
    * Importance: 
      it forms the groundwork of the mordern world which is heavily reliant on technology. Software products have made work 
      easier and are reliable, accessible, affordable and scalable, making it easy to solve real world challenges on the go.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 
    * 1970s: Waterfall structured programming model was proposed by Winston Royce.
    
    * 1990s: This period saw a rapid growth of web based applications and early forms of agile practices.
    
    * 2001: agile practices took shape and revolutionised development with keen interests in prioritizing flexibility, 
      collaboration and customer feedback.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

    * Idea generation: an idea is brought up to solve a specific problem. e.g. lack of access to healthcare.
    
    * Analysis of the requirements: what will the product require for it to solve the lack of access to healthcare e.g. in 
      order to enable the user to access the nearest health facility, or better yet, to access online medical attention 
      when the center(s) are experiencing a heavy traffic of patients, his/her location will be needed, internet 
      accessibility and a smart phone will be required. 

    * Product design: the outlook of the software is designed to enable a friendly and seemless user journey when       
      using the app/software.

    * Product development: Coding of the software is then done to make it executable and actualise the product design. 

    * Integration & testing: this involves testing whether the product does what it was created to do. Can it identify 
      heavy patient traffic in a specific healthcenter? Can it allow a patient to see a health care provider virtually?

    * Deployment: if the product has proven to be working just fine and is doing the work that it was built to do, it 
      is deployed for use by clients.

    * Maintenance: The product will need frequent scheduled and unscheduled updates to keep it afloat with the 
      changing technologies and improve its quality. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

    Waterfall methodology:
    - Linear and sequential approach to software development
    - Each phase is completed before the next one begins
    - Little flexibility hence changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete
    - Late customer feedback (after the product is developed)
    - Testing is done at the end of the development process.

    Agile methodology
    - Flexible, iterative and collaborative approach to software development focussing on delivering small working parts of 
      software quickly and continuously improving on it based on the client feedback
    - High flexibility allows adaptation to changing requirements
    - Regular customer feedback is easily incorporated into every sprint
    - Testing is continuous and done after each sprint/iteration.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

    Software Developer:
    - Designing and developing software using programming languages and frameworks such as python
    - Maintaing and upgrading software to ensure compatibility with newer technologies
    - Ensure security and data protection e.g encryption
    - Maintaining and updating software to keep it functional
    - Collaborating with other team members to ensure best practice when developing software and code reviws
    - Work with clients on the requirements to understand software needs
    - Test and debug to ensure quality code
    
    Quality Assurance Engineer:
    - Analyse the requirements of the project and identify testable components
    - Develop standard operating procedures for the programmers to follow
    - Ensure software meets quality standards before deployment. 
    - Test planning and execution to identify bugs and suggest appropriate changes. 
    - Develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.

    Project Manager:
    - Define the project scope, goals and deliverables, and lead the software development team.
    - Coordinates the team by assigning tasks and ensuring that the members understand the clients expectations
      act as the main point of contact between the development team and the clients
    - Track, document and communicate information regarding the project milestone.
    - Handover the completed product to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

    IDEs:
    - Has intelligent features for automatically writing or editing the source code
    - Format written text by automatically making some words bold or italic, or by using different font colors allowing the 
      source code to be more readable and give instant feedback about accidental syntax errors
    - Make suggestions to complete a code statement when the developer begins typing
    - Increases programmer productivity by performing repeatable development tasks that are typically part of every code 
      change
    - Converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand
    - Allows developers to automate unit tests locally before the software is integrated with other developers' code and 
      more complex integration tests are run
    - Integrate several debugging tools that highlight bugs caused by human error in real time, even as the developer is 
      typing.

    VCS:
    - Enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase without conflicts.
    - Records detailed history of changes, allowing easy analysis of each modification. 
    - Supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.
    - Allows reverting to previous versions if new changes introduce errors
    
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 

    - Rapid technological advancement: continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies
    
    - Time Constraints: adopt agile methodologies to streamline workflows
    
    - Limited Infrastructure: developers must rely heavily on a robust infrastructure to perform their jobs effectively
    
    - Changing Software Requirements: adopt agile methodologies, which enables flexibility
    
    - Software Security: research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats
    
    - Software Accessibility and Usability: Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

    Unit tests:
    - Involve testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software 
      ensuring that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components

    Integration tests:
    - Verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together
    - Ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected

    System testing:
    - Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions
    - Verifies that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and 
      security

    Acceptance tests: 
    - Verify if a system satisfies business requirements
    - They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors
    - Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment


                                # PART TWO: INTRODUCTION TO AI AND PROMPT ENGINEERING

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

    * Prompt engineering involves crafting texts to get high quality responses from language models.
    
    * importance in AI models: prompt engineering allows the creation of high quality and desired responses with AI models. 
      entry of vague texts and/or information is converted into a clear query in order to avoid a confusing response.
           
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

    Vague Prompt:
         - Is MAP a good predictor in healthcare?
         
    Improved prompt: 
         - Is MAP a good predictor of preeclampsia? In the context of preeclampsia (hypertensive disease in pregnancy), the 
           MAP (mean arterial blood pressusre) is a product of the blood pressure. 
         - The blood pressure always rises in preeclampsia. This is more effective as it has narrowed the 
          response/information down to preeclampsia/hypertensive disease in pregnancy.
